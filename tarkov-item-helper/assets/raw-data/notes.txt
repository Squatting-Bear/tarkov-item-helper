Getting the item short names:
- Downloaded UABE to extract asset files (AssetsBundleExtractor_2.2stabled_64bit.zip)
  - Put the exe in Documents/UABE (on wagga pc), C:\apps\AssetsBundleExtractor... (on sydney pc)
- Ran UABE and opened D:\Battlestate-Games\EscapeFromTarkov_Data\resources.assets
- Sort by file type then name (sorting is stable) ... OR sort by size; we want one of biggest
- Find TestBackendLocaleEn
- Export raw
  - made 'output' dir in Documents/UABE for it
- Copy file to tarkov-item-helper dir
- Edit to remove rubbish & cruft
  - illegal chars at start and end
  - only need "data"/"templates" attrib
- Some items were missing so I added them with fake ids near the top of the file
  e.g.
  "whitlock-fake-id-001": {
        "Name": "SSSh-95 Sfera-S helmet",
        "ShortName": "SFERA"
      }
- Sometime an item's name on the wiki doesn't match its name in the resources, so I created the
  name-fixes.json file for manual fixes.
- Unknown names will cause a failure in _getFromWikiReference() in data.ts.  There's a flag
  in the function (doingUpdate) which can be set to true to print an error instead of failing,
  to get a complete list of missing names instead of one at a time.
