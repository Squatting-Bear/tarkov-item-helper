Getting the item short names:
- Downloaded UABE to extract asset files (AssetsBundleExtractor_2.2stabled_64bit.zip)
  - Put the exe in Documents/UABE (on wagga pc)
- Ran UABE and opened D:\Battlestate-Games\EscapeFromTarkov_Data\resources.assets
- Sort by file type then name (sorting is stable)
- Find TestBackendLocaleEn
- Export raw
  - made 'output' dir in Documents/UABE for it
- Copy file to tarkov-item-helper dir
- Edit to remove rubbish & cruft
  - illegal chars at start and end
  - only need "data"/"templates" attrib
- Sometime an item's name on the wiki doesn't match its name in the resources, so I created the
  name-fixes.json file for manual fixes.
